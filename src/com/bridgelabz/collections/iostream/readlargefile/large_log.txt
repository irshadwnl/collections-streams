Efficient File Reading

Uses BufferedReader with FileReader to handle large files efficiently.

Reads the file line-by-line instead of loading it entirely into memory error.

Filtering Lines

Converts each line to lowercase and checks for the word error.

Prints only the matching lines.

Exception Handling error

Catches IOException to prevent crashes if the file is missing or unreadable.
